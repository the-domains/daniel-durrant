Do a quick search and scan through articles about the cognitive benefits of writing. If you're like me, you'll see some good evidence to support the habit of writing. 

Instead of aimless thinking, write to rewire your brain. When you feel an itch in your mind, it's the spider in your head telling you to write. You see, to write is to reweb your mind. It can extend your senses and ensnare insights that fly by. 

Virginia Woolf described fiction as a "a spider's web, so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners." With both reason and intuition, let the 'mind spider' stretch your mind. It's a cute metaphor.

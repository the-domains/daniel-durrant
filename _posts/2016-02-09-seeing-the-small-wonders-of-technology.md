My son's eyes light up in anticipation when I open the bottle of soapy water. For him, it's magic. As the bubbles I've blown slowly float down around him, he is filled with an innocent wonder. 

For all he knows, the bottle is filled with "bubbles".  Yep, my 22 month-old can say the word, but he has no sense of the scienctific concepts that underly bubbles: the surface tension, elacticity, chemistry, light, or even the geometry.

I often get the same feeling with technology. I love the devices in my life. Like using a bubble wand, I can exert a bit of energy to send a message from my smartphone. Like a bubble, it floats to the recipieneâ€‹t. It's magic. 

Few of us can explain the science of modern mechanisms. We know how to describe the surface of technology and our experiences with it, but beneath the surface, what it _actually is, _is not easily explainable.

As Arthur C. Clarke said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." What would we do without the magic makers in our lives?
